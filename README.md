Weekend Server Calculator!

## Description

This is an over-engineered calculator. You know, the one that you have built into your computer, and your phone.

This uses GET and POST requests to do the calculations on a server. All calculations are handled server side, WITHOUT using the eval() method. Instead, it relies on logic to find the operators, and evaluate your expression in PEMDAS order. Experiment with multiple operators!

Currently, does not support exponents... so PMDAS?

There is a built in check to make sure you have included all of the necessary data to submit. Must have at least two numbers and an operator, and if you choose to include parentheses, you must complete them and have both sides in there.

Does not support bigInt notation. 

Your most recent result is shown below the calculator. If you wish to go back to a previously entered expression, click on it in the history section. It'll bring the entered expression back to the calculator, and you can do more with it. 

If you wish to delete your history, click the "Delete History" button and confirm in the popup. This WILL delete the data server side as well. 

The C button will clear the calculator, but NOT the history.

the Back button will delete the last character in the calculator.

The input field for the calculator is readonly, you currently cannot type in your desired expression. Use the buttons I gave you! It took me a long time to make them work!

Please report any errors or bugs, and don't forget to have a nice day üòÅ!
